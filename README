# **DE Toxoplasma - rna-seq course**
In this repository, you will find all the code to reproduce my analysis based on the reads from Singhania et al. (2019) (only lung and blood tissues from wildtype and toxoplasma).

## Steps 
### Qualtiy check 
First use fastQC to assess the quality of the reads for the lung and the blood: [01_protocole_Lung](01_protocole_Lung.sh) and [02_protocole_Blood](02_protocole_Blood.sh)to create the fastqc reports, and then use MultiQC to have all your fastqc in one report with command Multiqc . , done in [03_download_gen_specie_+_multiqc](03_download_gen_specie_+_multiqc.sh).

### Creating the index
You will need to download the reference genome from ensembl [03_download_gen_specie_+_multiqc](03_download_gen_specie_+_multiqc.sh). Then run [04_hist2_index](04_hist2_index.sh), to avoid download many time, I take it in lland directory.

### Mapping the reads against the reference genome
To do that, run [05_hist2_mapping](05_hist2_mapping.sh), [06_sam_to_bam](06_sam_to_bam.sh), [07_bam_sort](07_bam_sort.sh) and [08_bam_index](08_bam_index.sh)
Then you will have a .bam and a .bam.bai file for each of your reads.

### Counting the number of reads per genes
You will need to download the annotation corresponding to the reference genome you download before. Then run [09_feature_count](09_feature_count.sh) and [10_Seq2](10_Seq2.sh) to get the count table that you will use for the next step. Download it locally.

Then you can run the R script [11_DESeq2_R](11_DESeq2_R.R).

## also find :
You have the [combineHisat2Map](combineHisat2Map.txt) to see alignment result.
